Reduce the cyclomatic complexity of eight audit-flagged functions (CC 16–24) by extracting behavior-preserving named helpers (#182–#189). No behavior change and no public API change — all existing tests stay green. Touched: `github()`'s callback (auth-github); `createInMemoryArtifactStore`, `serializeArtifactForCopy`, and `classifyRemoved` (plugin-canvas); `defineCopilot` (plugin-copilot); the realtime subscription effect (plugin-realtime); and `handleSttRequest`/`handleTtsRequest` (plugin-voice). Six functions now measure CC ≤ 10; `serializeArtifactForCopy` (a 9-kind discriminated-union exhaustive switch) and the in-memory `memList` sit at the idiomatic floor — `lizard`'s TypeScript parser mis-merges their adjacent module helpers into one range, overstating the per-function number, but each real function is ≤ 10.
